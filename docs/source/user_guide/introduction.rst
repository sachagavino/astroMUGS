What is astroMUGS?
=================
AstroMUGS is a package built to help use RAMSES outputs for post-processing with RADMC3D, POLARIS and NAUTILUS. 
It allows to easily convert RAMSES outputs into formats compatible with these radiative transfer and chemical modeling codes.
AstroMUGS is specifically designed to work with multi-grain dust models, making it a valuable tool for researchers working on astrophysical simulations involving dust dynamics, radiative transfer, and chemistry.
Using a notebook interface, astroMUGS provides a user-friendly way to handle complex data and perform necessary conversions in a few lines of code.
